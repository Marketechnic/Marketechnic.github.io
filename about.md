## About

Marketechnic is led by a seasoned expert with 20 years of global experience in the industrial equipment segment with roles progressing across engineering, program management, to SVP of Marketing & Sales.

Now, as a Clinical Assistant Professor teaching Executive MBAs at Kennesaw State University, I draw on my global experience to educate future business leaders and provide consulting services to family businesses around the world. 

Along with my electrical engineering background, my expertise extends to research and data science, where I utilize tools like Tableau, SPSS, and Python.
