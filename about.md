## About Me

As a Clinical Assistant Professor teaching Executive MBAs at Kennesaw State University, I draw on my global experience to educate future business leaders and provide consulting services to family businesses around the world. 

Along with my electrical engineering backgroung, my expertise extends to research and data science, where I utilize tools like Tableau, SPSS, and Python.
