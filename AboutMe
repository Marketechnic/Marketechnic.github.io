## About Me

As a Clinical Assistant Professor teaching Executive MBAs at Kennesaw State University, I leverage my global experience to educate future business leaders and consult for family businesses worldwide.  I also have extensive expertise in research and data science, using tools like Tableau, SPSS, and Python and am an electrical engineer by trade.
